                            <p>Since 2019, I have been developing websites and improving my web development skills. 2020-2022 I took a web-development course at a career center, and now I am studying to complete my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>

                            <p>Along with the in-person classes, I have taken several online courses for html, css and javascript. For CSS I have taken
                                some extra steps by learning SVG animations as well as some advanced css techniques for
                                animations.</p>

                            <p>Overall, I have spent way more time in Javascript. After learning the fundamentals, I started learning React. I fell in love and eventually found Nextjs. I have been improving my fullstack skills with Nextjs and AWS ever since.</p>

                            <p>Since 2020, I've not only been a web developer but also an ardent creator, pouring my heart into every line of code and design. Each website I've built is a testament to my love for the craft. From wireframing to color theory, every element serves a purpose and tells a part of the tale.</p>
                            <p> My journey into back-end development isn't just about understanding server functions or databases; it's about discovering how the magic happens behind the curtain. As I ventured deeper, I stumbled upon the titans of front-end: React, Angular, and Vue. React, in particular, resonated deeply with me, sparking an insatiable curiosity and desire to create.</p>

                        <div className='flex2'>
                            <h1 className='title'>React</h1>
                            <p>In 2021, during a class project, I saw an opportunity to not just complete an assignment but to create something mesmerizing. With my newfound knowledge of React, I built a portfolio that left everyone in awe. The dynamism, the captivating effects - they weren't just to impress; they were expressions of my passion. Using "useEffect" to create typewriter animations or scroll-based movements was a thrilling exploration of what was possible with React, and I was just scratching the surface.</p>

                            <h1 className='title'>NextJS</h1>
                            <p>Then came Next.js, a revelation in my web development journey. My initial fascination quickly evolved into a profound passion. This wasn't just another toolâ€”it was a game-changer. Every feature, from its integrated approach to back and front end development to the innovative server-side components in NextJS 13, became a new playground for me to explore. The boundless creative and technical possibilities it presented fueled my passion even more, compelling me to craft richer, more seamless user experiences.</p>

                            <p>Finally comes Amazon Web Services. From relational databases to S3 buckets, I have learned a lot about AWS. While I have only scratched the surface of what they have to offer, I am happy to have a solid foundation to build upon.</p>
